//!!! TO REDUCE DUPLICATE CODE AND WRITE MORE ASSERTIONS USE JEST'S GLOBAL METHODS
// @ https://jestjs.io/docs/api#beforeeachfn-timeout
// - afterAll(fn, timeout) - runs after all the cases in a test file complete
// - afterEach(fn, timeout) - runs after each test in a test file completes
// - beforeAll(fn, timeout) - runs once before any of the tests run
// - beforeEach(fn, timeout) - runs before each test case runs in a file

//!!! so we'll set up the spies for the component and then each test case can just use those
// - we want to define fresh copies before each test case
